# RGB Runner

RGB Runner is an endless runner game made for the [Global Game Jam 2026](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2026/rgb-run-7) where you must apply a set of colored lenses to decipher the code and find a safe path through.

## Controls

W/Up Arrow/Scroll Wheel Up - Next Lens

S/Down Arrow/Scroll Wheel Down - Previous Lens

A/Left Arrow - Move Left

Each lane of the track has an enciphered set of three numbers. You must use your lenses to decipher and locate one of the safe numbers displayed on your HUD, and choose that lane to safely pass the number gate.
